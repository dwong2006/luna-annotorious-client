# Luna Annotorious Client

Work in progress on a WebGL-based rewrite of the 
[Annotorious OpenSeadragon](https://recogito.github.io/annotorious/getting-started/osd-plugin/)
annotation library.

This project is a bespoke development, designed for integration
with the Luna Digital Asset Management System. The plan 
is to develop this code further step by step, ultimately making
it the basis for Annotorious version 3.
